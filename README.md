# What is SIA?

SIA, short for Super-Intelligent AI Assistant, is a joke on words similar to JARVIS from ironman. It's meant to be ran on a raspberry pi with a microphone, speakers, or on linux in order to assist users. The original developer's website is here: https://openjarvis.com/

I plan on modifying the code to add OpenCV (Computer Vision) and AI to the project, as well as potentially a HUD / Custom user-interface to integrate with smart-glasses or any smart device. A custom OS titled "AstraOS".
